Frontend mentor challenge

To practise DOM manipulation, I used vanilla JS to create DOM elements instead of hard-coded into the HTML file.

This is the first project that I started styling in mobile layout and later into desktop layout. This process of starting from mobile layout and then later into desktop layout is better and easier than what I normally used to.
